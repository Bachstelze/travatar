- predicate :
	* boost library
	* cmake
	* autoconf
	* automake

- to compile and install :

Then run ./cbuild.sh [PREFIX] to install it into the prefix directory.
No PREFIX will intall it into /bin, be carefull ;0)

at last to use it simply run tercpp, it will show you the whole option needed.

Enjoy !!!
